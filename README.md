# ArduinoEthernetShield
This project involves a user-friendly web interface implemented with an Arduino Uno and Ethernet shield. The Arduino acts as a web server, enabling remote control of simulated traffic lights. Users can effortlessly toggle the state of green and red LEDs, representing "GO" and "STOP" signals, respectively.
